<h1>Cookie Policy for BrewMetrics</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 4, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 27, 2024</p> <!-- Or current date -->

<p>This Cookie Policy explains how BrewMetrics ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies on our website www.brewmetrics.xyz (the "Website") and our web application https://brewmetrics-xyz-app-e8d51.web.app/index.html (the "Service"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.</p>

<p>Please read this policy in conjunction with our <a href="/privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> [**LAWYER NOTE:** Ensure this link points to your actual Privacy Policy page], which provides additional details about how we collect and use information.</p>

<h2>What are Cookies?</h2>

<p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or use an online service. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

<p>Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, BrewMetrics) are called "first-party cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., analytics, payment processing).</p>

<h2>Why Do We Use Cookies?</h2>

<p>We use first-party and potentially third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website and Service to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and understand the usage patterns of our users to enhance the experience on our Website and Service (these are typically "performance" or "analytics" cookies).</p>

<h2>Types of Cookies We Use</h2>

<p>The specific types of first-party and third-party cookies served through our Website and Service and the purposes they perform are described below:</p>

<h3>1. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These cookies are essential to provide you with services available through our Website and Service and to enable you to use some of their core features, such as accessing secure areas (like your brewery dashboard), managing your session, ensuring security, and processing payments via third parties like Stripe.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Website and Service to you, you cannot refuse them without impacting how our site functions. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings (see "How Can I Control Cookies?" below), but this may affect your ability to use the Website and Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Session cookies (<code>JSESSIONID</code>, <code>sessionid</code>, etc.), security cookies (CSRF tokens), cookies set by Stripe during checkout.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Performance and Analytics Cookies</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Website and Service are being used or how effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Website and Service for you. This helps us improve our offerings.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> These cookies are non-essential. We will typically ask for your consent via a cookie consent banner before placing these cookies on your device.</li>
    <li><strong>Examples:</strong> Cookies set by Google Analytics (e.g., <code>_ga</code>, <code>_gid</code>) to track website traffic and user behavior anonymously.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Collected:</strong> These typically collect pseudonymized data like IP address (often anonymized), browser type, pages visited, time spent on pages, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Functionality Cookies (Limited Use, If Any)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These cookies enable the website to provide enhanced functionality and personalization, like remembering choices you make (e.g., language preferences). They may be set by us or by third-party providers whose services we have added to our pages.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> These cookies are non-essential and typically require your consent via our cookie consent banner.</li>
    <li><strong>Current Use:</strong> [**LAWYER NOTE/ACTION ITEM:** State clearly if you currently use *any* functionality cookies. If not, you can state: "We currently do not use Functionality Cookies extensively, but if we do in the future, they will be managed through our cookie consent options."]</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Targeting/Advertising Cookies (Likely Not Used Directly)</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> These cookies are used to make advertising messages more relevant to you. They perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing, ensuring that ads are properly displayed, and in some cases selecting advertisements based on your interests.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> These cookies are non-essential and require your explicit consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Current Use:</strong> [**LAWYER NOTE/ACTION ITEM:** State clearly if you use *any* advertising cookies. If not, state: "BrewMetrics does not directly place targeting or advertising cookies on its Website or Service. However, third-party services embedded on our site, if any, might do so according to their own policies."]</li>
</ul>

<h2>Third-Party Cookies</h2>

<p>In addition to our own cookies, we may also use various third-parties cookies, for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> To analyze the use of our Website. Google Analytics gathers information about website use by means of cookies. The information gathered is used to create reports about the use of our Website. Google's privacy policy is available at: <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/</a></li>
    <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> Our payment processor uses cookies necessary for secure payment processing and fraud prevention. Stripe's cookie policy can typically be found on their website.</li>
</ul>
<p>These third parties control the setting of these cookies, so we recommend you check the third-party websites for more information about their cookies and how to manage them.</p>

<h2>How Can I Control Cookies?</h2>

<p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject non-essential cookies.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cookie Consent Banner/Tool:</strong> [**LAWYER NOTE/ACTION ITEM:** You need to implement this.] When you first visit our Website, you should be presented with a cookie consent banner or tool. This tool allows you to review the categories of cookies we use and provide or withdraw your consent for non-essential cookies (like Analytics or Functionality cookies). Your preferences will be saved for future visits (usually via a cookie itself!).</li>
    <li><strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings preferences. You can set your browser to accept or refuse cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is set. You can also usually delete cookies that have already been set. Please note that if you choose to block or delete cookies, especially strictly necessary cookies, certain features of our Website or Service may not operate correctly.
