<h1>Privacy Policy for BrewMetrics</h1>

<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 4, 2025</p>
<p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> April 27, 2024</p> <!-- Or current date -->

<p>BrewMetrics ("we," "us," or "our"), operated as a sole proprietorship based in Flagstaff, AZ 86005, runs the website www.brewmetrics.xyz (the "Website") and the BrewMetrics web application located at https://brewmetrics-xyz-app-e8d51.web.app/index.html (the "Service"). This Privacy Policy informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of data when you use our Website and Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

<p>We use limited data to provide and improve the Website and Service. By using the Website or Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>

<p><strong>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access the Website or use the Service.</strong></p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<p>We collect minimal information necessary to provide and improve our Service.</p>

<p><strong>a) Personal Data Provided by You (Our Brewery Clients):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you register for an account on our Service, we collect information necessary to manage your account, such as your brewery name, a contact email address, and password. You may optionally provide a contact person name, phone number (e.g., 928-298-5415), or physical address.</li>
    <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> To process payments for subscriptions, we utilize a third-party payment processor (Stripe). We do not directly collect or store your full credit card information. Stripe provides us with transaction confirmations and necessary details for billing management. Please review Stripe's Privacy Policy for their data handling practices.</li>
    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> If you contact us directly (e.g., via email at info@brewmetrics.xyz or phone at 928-298-5415), we will have a record of that communication and any information you voluntarily provide within it.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>b) Data Processed on Behalf of Our Brewery Clients (Rating Data from Brewery Patrons):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Rating Data:</strong> Our Service allows our brewery clients ("Clients") to collect feedback, primarily in the form of numerical ratings or predefined selections, from their customers ("Patrons") regarding beverages. When Patrons submit ratings through the Service's forms (accessed via QR codes generated by the Client), we process this rating data on behalf of our Client.</li>
    <li><strong>No Patron Personal Data Collected via Forms:</strong> We **do not** collect personal identifiers like names, email addresses, or phone numbers directly from Patrons through our standard rating forms. The data collected is focused solely on the beverage rating itself.</li>
    <li><strong>Third-Party Review Links:</strong> The Service *may* provide Patrons with a link to leave a review on third-party platforms like Google My Business, potentially alongside a promotional offer provided by the Client (e.g., a discount for an honest review). BrewMetrics **does not** collect, process, or store the content of reviews left on such third-party platforms. Patrons' interactions with those third-party sites are governed by the privacy policies of those sites (e.g., Google).</li>
    <li><strong>Data Processor Role:</strong> For the rating data collected via our forms, BrewMetrics acts as a Data Processor on behalf of the Brewery Client, who is the Data Controller. We use this rating data solely to provide the Service features (like dashboards) to our Client and for aggregated, anonymized analytics to improve the Service.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>c) Automatically Collected Data (Usage Data):</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Log and Usage Data:</strong> Like most websites and online services, we may automatically collect information when you access and use the Website or Service. This may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, pages visited, time spent, device identifiers, and other diagnostic data. This helps us understand usage patterns and improve the Service.</li>
    <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</strong> We use essential cookies required for the operation of the Website and Service (e.g., session management). We may also use cookies for analytics purposes to understand how our Service is used. You can typically manage cookie preferences through your browser settings. (Consider a separate Cookie Policy and consent banner if using extensive analytics or marketing cookies).</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

    <li>Providing, operating, and maintaining our Website and Service</li>
    <li>Managing your account, subscriptions, and billing</li>
    <li>Processing payments via our third-party processor</li>
    <li>Communicating with you about your account, support requests (via info@brewmetrics.xyz, 928-298-5415, etc.), or important service updates</li>
    <li>Providing customer support</li>
    <li>Analyzing usage trends (using aggregated/anonymized data) to improve the Service</li>
    <li>Monitoring the security and technical functioning of the Service</li>
    <li>Detecting and preventing fraud or technical issues</li>
    <li>Complying with legal obligations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>

<p>We share information only in limited circumstances:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We share information with third-party service providers essential for our operations, such as payment processing (Stripe) and potentially hosting services or analytics providers. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your data and use it only for the services they provide to us.</li>
    <li><strong>For Business Transfers:</strong> If BrewMetrics (as a sole proprietorship or future entity) is involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information might be transferred as part of that transaction. We would provide notice if your information becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
    <li><strong>To Comply with Laws:</strong> We will disclose your information where required to do so by law or subpoena or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or integrity of our Service.</li>
    <li><strong>To Protect Rights:</strong> We may disclose information to protect our rights, property, or personal safety, or that of others.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not sell your personal information.</p>

<h2>4. Data Retention</h2>

<p>We retain your Client Account Information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Service, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Rating data processed on behalf of Clients is typically retained while the Client's account is active, subject to our data management policies.</p>

<h2>5. Data Security</h2>

<p>We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical security measures designed to protect the information we collect. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

<h2>6. Your Data Protection Rights (For Brewery Clients)</h2>

<p>As a Brewery Client, you have certain rights regarding the personal information we hold about you:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The right to access, update, or delete the personal information we have on you (primarily your Account Information).</li>
    <li>The right to rectify inaccurate information.</li>
    <li>The right to object to or restrict certain processing activities.</li>
    <li>The right to withdraw consent where consent was the basis for processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise these rights, please contact us at info@brewmetrics.xyz. We do not hold identifiable personal information from brewery Patrons collected via our rating forms, so requests regarding Patron data should generally be directed to the Brewery Client (the Data Controller).</p>

<h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>Our Service is intended for businesses (breweries) and is not directed at individuals under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 18. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>

<h2>8. Links to Other Websites</h2>

<p>Our Website or Service may contain links to other websites (like our Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/brew.metrics.app/ or Google My Business) not operated by us. We are not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies.</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We will notify you of significant changes by posting the new policy on the Website and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.</p>
